# BrainDrive
Graphs Brain Data (different forms (delta, alpha, etc...) ) and sees if you are sleepy or not aware to the road
This invention (my science fair) is greatly based on another one I found, which graphs brain data using the mindflex eeg headset. 
I added a bit of code so I could focus on one type of brain wave(low alpha) which indicates sleep or closing of the eyes.
To wire the mindflex eeg headset, look on this website:http://www.frontiernerds.com/brain-hack. 
For this project you will need the following: the Arduino Uno, the mindflex headset with neurosky chip, and the arduino software. Also, 
you will need a computer, which, if you don't have, well, that's just sad.
